        <h1>About my skills</h1><br>
        <p>I possess proficient skills in Java, Python, and C languages, showcasing a strong foundation in
            programming and algorithmic problem-solving. With hands-on experience in these versatile languages, I
            have successfully developed applications, scripts, and algorithms that demonstrate my ability to tackle
            complex problems and deliver effective solutions.</p><br>
        <p>In Java, I have a solid understanding of object-oriented programming principles, allowing me to design
            and implement robust and scalable applications. My experience with Java extends to various domains,
            including software development, backend systems, and enterprise-level applications.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Python serves as another key area of expertise, where my proficiency spans scripting, data analysis, and
            web development. I have leveraged Python for tasks such as automating workflows, processing large
            datasets, and developing web applications using popular frameworks like Django or Flask.</p>
        <br>
        <p>C language proficiency further strengthens my programming capabilities, providing a low-level
            understanding of computer architecture and system-level programming. This skill set enables me to
            optimize code for efficiency and performance, making me versatile in diverse programming environments.
        </p><br>
        <p>While my primary strengths lie in these programming languages, I have some exposure to HTML and CSS for
            web development. Although my experience in HTML and CSS is limited, I understand their fundamental
            principles and can create basic web pages. This foundational knowledge allows me to collaborate
            effectively with front-end developers and contribute to projects that require a combination of
            programming and web development skills.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In summary, my expertise in Java, Python, and C, coupled with a foundational understanding of HTML and
            CSS, positions me as a versatile and adaptable programmer capable of contributing to a wide range of
            projects across different domains. I am eager to continue expanding my skill set and taking on new
            challenges to further enhance my proficiency in both backend and web development.</p>
