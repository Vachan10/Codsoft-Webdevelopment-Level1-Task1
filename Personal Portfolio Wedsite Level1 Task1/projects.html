                    <p>
                    <p>
                        In the IBM Z Day Datathon event, our team embarked on an innovative project aimed at
                        revolutionizing the startup ecosystem by harnessing the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
                        Our goal was to create a dynamic and efficient online platform that would serve as a bridge
                        between ambitious startup entrepreneurs and prospective investors.

                        The centerpiece of our project is a sophisticated AI-driven website designed to streamline the
                        often intricate process of connecting startups with investors. Leveraging the robust
                        capabilities of IBM Z technology, we developed an intelligent matchmaking algorithm that
                        analyzes various parameters, such as industry, business model, and growth potential, to
                        facilitate meaningful and mutually beneficial connections.

                    <h3>Key Features:</h3>

                    Smart Profiling System: Our platform employs AI algorithms to create comprehensive profiles for
                    both startup entrepreneurs and investors. These profiles go beyond basic information, delving
                    into the core values, goals, and preferences of each participant.

                    Dynamic Matchmaking Algorithm: The heart of our project lies in an advanced AI-driven
                    matchmaking algorithm that considers a multitude of factors to pair startups with investors who
                    align with their vision and objectives. This dynamic system ensures a higher likelihood of
                    successful and compatible partnerships.

                    Real-time Collaboration Tools: To enhance communication and collaboration, we integrated
                    real-time messaging, video conferencing, and document sharing features directly within the
                    platform. This facilitates efficient interaction between entrepreneurs and investors, fostering
                    a seamless connection-building process.

                    Data Security and Privacy: Recognizing the importance of safeguarding sensitive information, we
                    prioritized robust security measures, utilizing IBM Z's trusted capabilities to ensure the
                    highest standards of data protection and privacy.

                    User-Friendly Interface: The platform boasts an intuitive and user-friendly interface, ensuring
                    that both startup entrepreneurs and investors can navigate effortlessly through the website.
                    This design focus aims to enhance the overall user experience and encourage active
                    participation.

                    <h3>Impact and Future Prospects:</h3>
                    Our AI-driven platform has the potential to significantly transform the startup-investor
                    matchmaking landscape, fostering innovation and growth within the entrepreneurial community. By
                    participating in the IBM Z Day Datathon, we not only demonstrated the capabilities of AI in
                    solving real-world challenges but also paved the way for future advancements in connecting
                    diverse stakeholders within the business ecosystem. Our project aligns with the ethos of
                    leveraging cutting-edge technology for positive societal impact, and we look forward to further
                    refining and expanding our platform in collaboration with the broader entrepreneurial and
                    investor communities.

                    <h2>2.Calculator Website</h2>
                    <p>For my latest project, I undertook the task of creating a fully functional and aesthetically
                        pleasing calculator website using HTML and CSS. The primary objective was to develop a
                        user-friendly interface that seamlessly integrates form and function, catering to both the
                        practical needs of a calculator and the visual preferences of users.</p>
                    <p>This project highlights the versatility of HTML and CSS in creating functional and visually
                        appealing web applications. The calculator website serves as a practical tool for users while
                        showcasing the importance of design in enhancing user engagement. As I continue to refine this
                        project, future developments may include additional scientific calculator functions, improved
                        styling features, and potential integration with JavaScript for enhanced interactivity. This
                        endeavor underscores the power of HTML and CSS in crafting efficient and stylish web
                        applications tailored to user needs.</p>
